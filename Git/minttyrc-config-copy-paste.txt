This mintty bug CTRL + C & CTRL + V copy paste addresses the issue. It allows normal Control-C, Control-V copy and pasting, but at the expense of changing other control characters. So to stop a process running you need Control-Shift-C, to interrupt it you would need Control-Shift-Z and to send an EOT you need Control-Shift-D. You may find the advantage of windows copy and paste outwights the disadvantages.

The behavior needs a flag to be set in the .minttyrc file. WHich should look like

CtrlShiftShortcuts=yes
CtrlExchangeShift=yes
